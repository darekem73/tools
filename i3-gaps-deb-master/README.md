# i3-gaps-deb
Tool to create and install Debian (or Ubuntu) packages of _i3-gaps_.

## How does it work?
It uses the newest stuff from [here](https://github.com/Airblader/i3),
makes some modifications (only if necessary for the _building step_)
and finally produces common Debian packages.

## What's the purpose?
_i3-gaps_ simply does not exist in Debian (so far).

## Works for what?
  - Debian "jessie" _and later_.
  - Ubuntu "yakkety" _and later_.

## Credits
Thanks to [stapelberg](https://github.com/stapelberg) for creating
[i3](http://i3wm.org/) and [Airblader](https://github.com/Airblader)
for the _gaps part_  (...and of course to _anyone else_ contributing to _i3_).

## Beer
Hey, I'm [thirsty](http://gunbomber.org/donation.html) like hell... _;-)_
