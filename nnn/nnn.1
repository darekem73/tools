.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
(Noice is Not Noice) is a performance-optimized, feature-packed fork of noice (http://git.2f30.org/noice/) with seamless desktop integration, simplified navigation, \fInavigate-as-you-type\fR mode with auto select, disk usage analyzer mode, bookmarks, contexts, application launcher, familiar navigation shortcuts, subshell spawning and much more. It remains a simple and efficient file manager that stays out of your way.
.Pp
.Nm
opens the current working directory by default if
.Ar PATH
is not specified.
.Sh KEYBINDS
.Pp
Press \fB?\fR in
.Nm
to see the list of keybinds.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Pp
.Nm
supports the following options:
.Pp
.Fl "b key"
        specify bookmark key to open
.Pp
.Fl d
        show hidden files
.Pp
.Fl e
        use exiftool instead of mediainfo
.Pp
.Fl i
        start in navigate-as-you-type mode
.Pp
.Fl l
        start in light mode (fewer details)
.Pp
.Fl "p file"
        copy (or \fIpick\fR) selection to file, or stdout if file='-'
.Pp
.Fl s
        use substring match for filters instead of regex
.Pp
.Fl S
        start in disk usage analyzer mode
.Pp
.Fl v
        show version and exit
.Pp
.Fl w
        wild load - entries unsorted on directory load
.Pp
.Fl h
        show program help and exit
.Sh CONFIGURATION
.Nm
uses \fIxdg-open\fR (on Linux) and \fIopen(1)\fR (on macOS) as the desktop opener.
.Pp
There is no configuration file. Settings work on environment variables. See ENVIRONMENT section below.
.Pp
Configuring
.Nm
to change to the last visited directory on quit requires shell integration in a
few easy steps. Look up NNN_TMPFILE in the ENVIRONMENT section below.
.Sh CONTEXTS
Contexts serve the purpose of exploring multiple directories simultaneously. 4 contexts
are available. The status of the contexts are shown in the top left corner:
.Pp
- the current context is in reverse
.br
- other active contexts are underlined
.br
- rest are inactive
.Pp
To switch to a context press the Leader key followed by the context number (1-4).
.Pp
The first time a context is entered, it copies the state of the last visited context. Each context remembers its last visited directory.
.Pp
When a context is quit, the next active context is selected. If the last active context is quit, the program quits.
.Pp
Each context can have its own directory color specified. See ENVIRONMENT section below.
.Sh FILTERS
Filters support regexes (default) to instantly (search-as-you-type) list the matching
entries in the current directory.
.Pp
Common use cases:
.Pp
(1) To list all matches starting with the filter expression, start the expression
with a '^' (caret) symbol.
.br
(2) Type '\\.mkv' to list all MKV files.
.br
(3) Use '.*' to match any character (\fIsort of\fR fuzzy search).
.Pp
There is a program option to filter entries by substring match instead of regex.
.Pp
In the \fInavigate-as-you-type\fR mode directories are opened in filter mode,
allowing continuous navigation. Works best with the \fBarrow keys\fR.
.br
When there's a unique match and it's a directory, `nnn` auto selects the directory and enters it in this mode.
.br
The \fIwild load\fR option can be extremely handy for users who use the \fInavigate-as-you-type\fR mode constantly. The entries are unsorted when the directory loads. Applying filters sorts the entries (with directories on top). Directory color is disabled in this mode.
.Sh SELECTION
Use \fI^K\fR to select the file under the cursor.
.Pp
To select multiple files the selection mode should be enabled using \fI^Y\fR.
In this mode it's possible to
.Pp
(1) cherry-pick individual files one by one by pressing <kbd>^K</kbd> on each entry (works across directories and contexts); or,
.br
(2) navigate to another file in the same directory to select a range of files.
.Pp
Press \fI^Y\fR again to save the selection and exit selection mode.
.Pp
Selected files are visually indicated by a \fB+\fR before the entries.
.br
The files in the list can now be listed, copied, moved, removed, archived or linked.
.br
Absolute paths of the selected files are copied to the temporary file \fB~/.config/nnn/.selection\fR. The path is shown in the help and configuration screen. If \fB$NNN_COPIER\fR is set (see ENVIRONMENT section below) the file paths are also copied to the system clipboard.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The SHELL, EDITOR (VISUAL, if defined) and PAGER environment variables take precedence
when dealing with the !, e and p commands respectively. A single combination to arguments is supported for SHELL and PAGER.
.Pp
\fBNNN_BMS:\fR bookmark string as \fIkey_char:location\fR pairs (max 10) separated by
\fI;\fR:
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_BMS='d:~/Documents;u:/home/user/Cam Uploads;D:~/Downloads/'

    NOTE: Bookmark keys should be single-character to use them in combination with the Leader key.
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_OPENER:\fR specify a custom file opener.
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_OPENER=mimeopen
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_CONTEXT_COLORS:\fR string of color codes for each context, e.g.:
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_CONTEXT_COLORS='1234'

    codes: 0-black, 1-red, 2-green, 3-yellow, 4-blue (default), 5-magenta, 6-cyan, 7-white

.Pp
\fBNNN_IDLE_TIMEOUT:\fR set idle timeout (in seconds) to invoke terminal locker (default: disabled).
.Pp

    The path is shown in the help and configuration screen.
.Ed
.Pp

.Bd -literal
    export NNN_NOTE='/home/user/.mynotes'
.Ed

files.
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_USE_EDITOR=1
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_NO_AUTOSELECT:\fR disable directory auto-selection in \fInavigate-as-you-type\fR mode.
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_NO_AUTOSELECT=1
.Ed
.Pp

.Bd -literal
    export NNN_RESTRICT_NAV_OPEN=1
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_TRASH:\fR trash (instead of \fIdelete\fR) files to desktop Trash.
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_TRASH=1
